# NPP Reporting
As explained earlier, the current NPP pilot system is mostly "headless", i.e. the NPP services running in the backend communicate with the partners' backend systems to facilitate the implemented use cases. While it might be desirable to have some basic interactive reporting capability be part of the NPP, this has not been part of the original project scope.

It is however possible to leverage the available (APDS-based) NPP interface for feeding an external reporting system. A document that provides guidance on how to accomplish this is available from Parking Matters.
